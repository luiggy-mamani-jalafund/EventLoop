# Event Loop Integration Script Documentation

The script automates the process of compiling a Java project, creating a JAR file, and copying it to the **Client** project, which uses Gradle. Once the JAR is copied, the script will trigger a Gradle build in the **Client** project to verify the integration. The update to the **Client** project's `build.gradle` to include the JAR as a dependency must be done manually.

## Running the Script

1. Ensure the script has the permissions for execution:
    ```bash
    chmod +x integrate_event_loop.sh
    ```
2. To execute the script, run the following command:
    ```bash
    ./integrate_event_loop.sh
    ```

**Expected output**

```bash
âžœ ./integrate_event_loop.sh
