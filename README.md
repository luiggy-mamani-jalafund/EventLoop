# Software Development Management
We used Trello tool to track our progress development for this project, here is the link where you can see our dashboard Trello:

# Event Loop Integration Script Documentation

The script automates the process of compiling a Java project, creating a JAR file, and copying it to the **Client** project, which uses Gradle. Once the JAR is copied, the script will trigger a Gradle build in the **Client** project to verify the integration. The update to the **Client** project's `build.gradle` to include the JAR as a dependency must be done manually.

## Running the Script

1. Ensure the script has the permissions for execution:
    ```bash
    chmod +x integrate_event_loop.sh
    ```
2. To execute the script, run the following command:
    ```bash
    ./integrate_event_loop.sh
    ```

**Expected output**

```bash
âžœ ./integrate_event_loop.sh

# Examples

## Fibonacci
In this example we will use the event loop to handle the creation of the UI and the change of the incrementing and decrementing number input `as Immediate tasks that will go to the Call Stack`, and the Fibonacci calculation will be `handled as a promise` as an input and output operation, where the number will be the input and the `result will be the output that will be handled with callbacks` to display it in the UI.

**As seen in the example, the increment operations (Call Stack Tasks) are not interrupted while the Fibonacci calculation is being done (Promise that will be sent to the MicroTask Queue).**

## Circle Pop Game
In this example, we use the event loop to manage both UI rendering and game logic. The appearance of balloons is handled as `recurring interval tasks` managed by the Timer Queue, while interactions like popping balloons and updating the score are `immediate tasks` sent to the Call Stack.

As balloons are clicked, `the event loop ensures immediate UI updates` (removal of balloons and score increment). Additionally, dynamic speed adjustments for balloon spawning are achieved by modifying the interval timing directly, showcasing `the flexibility of interval-based scheduling.`

**As seen in the example, the Call Stack processes immediate tasks (like balloon pops) without blocking the spawning of new balloons (Timer Queue), maintaining a smooth gameplay experience.**
